    <h2>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>Optical Illusion is an illusion caused by the visual system percept what appears to differ from reality. Due to the arrangement of images, effect of colors, light source, angle or other variables which mislead visual effects can be seen.</p>
    <p>An object with four rounded shapes interconnected seen in the image of the left. If we placed in front of a mirror and the reflection of the object shape should remain the same. It is not, why is that? This is Optical Illusion. Due to the lenght, area, size, direction and seeing angle causes our visual system repsonds to environmental stimuli and how our brain then interprets this information. Which why we seeing the reflection shape is square not round. The learner will understand how optical illusion works.</p>
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Student will explore ways in which attention and preception related to illusion</li>
        <li>Student will use their own reflections to build a peronsal idea about optical illusion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Elements</h2>
    <p><b>Contrast: </b>I made title of the image much larger and bold to emphasize the concept I trying to teach. I added the text "Square?" to the mirror reflection of the shape to be more engaing to reader. Also, removed all unnecessary background around the shape to hightlight the importance and direct reader attention to it. This makes the images stand out and help readers quickly focus the shapes on the image.</p>
    <p><b>Repetition: </b>I repeated the use of font and shapes throughout my design. All the text uses different colors but same font with a light font weight. I repeated use the same shape to convey the concept with my design.</p>
    <p><b>Alignment: </b>I placed the title of the concept on the top left where most likely first thing readers read. I want readers to know the concept the image want to convery before hand. The image is divided into 2 columns. The left column has the original shape/object. The right column has the same shape/object but it is reflected off a mirror. The mirror reflection of the shape/object is completely differet than original as if there 2 different shape/object begin with.</p>
    <p><b>Proximity: </b>I grouped the whole image into 2 columns so it's easier to understand the concept I'm trying to teach. The reader will start from the left and result is on the right. Everything is placed relative close to each other to guide the reader along.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Working with digital images had been a challenge as I don't really know much about image editing and/or PhotoShop. As a result, I had to learn and research many new things to achieve my design. I spent many hours trying to figure out how use PhotoShop and Illustrator to apply the elements of designs. Overall, it was a satisfy experience. Before, I had no idea what is contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity and how to incorporate in my digital image. Through this project, I learned how to use elements of design make create digital image.</p>
